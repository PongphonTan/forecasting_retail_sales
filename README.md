Project report's preface:

This project report is prepared as part of the subject of Statistical Modelling (SCMA478)
in Actuarial Science in the academic year 2019 (Semester 2). This report presents the optimal
model for our dataset by using time series technique.

The report starts with data visualization of the selected data, identify the objective of this
report and the reason why we selected this data, perform ARIMA models, show the results from
R and discuss the plot, perform SSE criteria, as well as the new technique (Neural Network
model)

This report is primarily addressed to those who are interested in fitting a dataset with an
ARIMA model. We sincerely hope that this report will be more or less informative and useful.
Grateful acknowledgment is here made to those who helped this researcher gather data
for this paper. This work would not have reached its present form without their invaluable help.
